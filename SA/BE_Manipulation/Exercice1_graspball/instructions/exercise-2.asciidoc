Manipulation planning
=====================

Objective
---------

Define a constraint graph and plan a manipulation path.

Introduction
------------
Open a terminal, cd into hpp-practicals directory and open 3 tab by typing CTRL+SHIFT+T
twice. In the first terminal, type
[source,sh]
----
hpp-manipulation-server
----

In the second terminal, type
[source,sh]
----
gepetto-gui
----

In the third terminal, type
[source,sh]
----
cd script
python -i grasp_ball.py
----

image::manipulation.png[width="40%",alt="hpp-gui graphical interface"]

You should see the above manipulator on a horizontal plane and a ball.
You can display the initial and goal configurations of the problem defined in
the script by typing respectively

[source,python]
----
r (q_init)
r (q_goal)
----

Displaying the constraint graph
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

in the python terminal. You can display the constraint graph by typing

[source,python]
----
graph.display (format='svg')
----

The graph should be displayed in a brower. By moving the mouse on
nodes and edges, you can see the constraints associated to each graph
element.

Solving the problem
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Typing
[source,python]
----
ps.solve ()
----
should solve the problem in a minute or so.

Displaying the path
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As in exercise 1, the path can be displayed using the path player
[source,python]

A more difficult problem
------------------------

script +grasp_ball_in_box.py+ defines the same problem as
+grasp_ball.py+, except that in the initial configuration, the ball
is in a box. The resolution takes a lot more time since RRT algorithm
needs to generate a lot of nodes before the gripper reaches the
initial configuration of the box.

Exercise 2
----------

Exercise 2.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to help the manipulation planner, define a constraint graph with
intermediate states like for instance:

- a state where the gripper is empty above the ball
- a state where the gripper holds the ball above the ground.

The graph below provides an example.

image::constraintgraph.png[width="40%",alt="Constraint graph"]

WARNING: In method +graph.createNode+ the order of the nodes in the list given as input is important: when checking in which node a configuration lies, node constraints will be checked in the order of node creation.

Exercise 2.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using the above constraint graph, write a script that builds a sequence of paths
from +q_init+ to +q_goal+. An example of how to generate a path from +q_init+ to a grasp configuration is provided by script +solve_by_hand.py+, for the manipulation problem without box.

The script, named +solve_by_hand_with_box.py+ should define a list of
indices named +paths+ corresponding to indices in the vector of paths. Each path should be admissible with respect to the manipulation constraints, and the concatenation of the paths should start at +q_init+ and end at +q_goal+.

Hints
-----

Displaying the constraint graph
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Type in a terminal

[source,sh]
----
hpp-plot-manipulation-graph
----
The following window should pop up.

image::hpp-plot-manipulation-graph.png[width="40%",alt="hpp-plot-manipulation-graph"]

Click on buttons "Refresh" and "Statistics" to display the current constraint graph.

By clicking on edges, you can see some statistics about the roadmap extension.

Some useful methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[source,python]
----
# create a relative transformation constraint between two joints
#
#  name   :            name of the constraint,
#  joint1 :            name of the first joint,
#  joint2 :            name of the second joint,
#  relativeTransform : relative transformation of joint2 frame in joint1 frame,
#  mask :              list of 6 Boolean to select active coordinates of the constraint.
ps.createTransformationConstraint (name, joint1, joint2, relativeTransform, mask)

# Set whether right hand side of constraint is constant
#
#  name :     name of the constraint,
#  constant : Boolean value.
ps.setConstantRightHandSide (name, constant)

# Create nodes of the constraint graph
#
#  nodeList: list of names of the nodes to be created.
#
#  note:     Nodes are ordered according to the list passed to this method. When
#            determining to which node a configuration belongs, constraints of
#            the nodes are tested in the creation order. As a consequence, it
#            is important that if the subspace defined by "node1" is a subset of
#            the subspace defined by "node2", "node1" is placed before "node2"
#            in the input list.
graph.createNode (nodeList)

# Create an edge of the constraint graph
#
#  node1:     name of the node the edge starts from,
#  node2:     name of the node the edge reaches,
#  edgeName:  name of the edge,
#  belongsTo: name of the node in the subspace defined by which paths of the edge lie.
graph.createEdge (node1, node2, edgeName, weight, belongsTo)

# Set constraint relative to nodes and edges
#
#  nodeName :   name of the node
#  edgeName :   name of the edge
#  constraints: list of names of constraints to be passed to the node or edge
#
#  note:        one and only one argument between node and edge should be
#              provided.
graph.setConstraints (node = nodeName, edge = edgeName, numConstraints = constraints)

# Project a configuration on the supspace defined by a node
#
#  nodeName: name of the node,
#  q:        input configuration.
#
#  return:
#    whether projection succeeded (Boolean),
#    projected configuration,
#    numerical error
graph.applyNodeConstraints (nodeName, q)

# Project a configuration on a leaf of the foliation defined by an edge
#
#  edgeName: name of the edge,
#  q1:       configuration defining the leaf (right hand side of constraint),
#  q2:       configuration to project on the leaf.
graph.generateTargetConfig (edgeName, q1, q2)
