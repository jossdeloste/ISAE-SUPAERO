Programming RRT algorithm
=========================

Objective
---------
Program RRT algorithm in python.

Introduction
------------
Open a terminal cd into hpp-practicals directory and open 3 tab by typing CTRL+SHIFT+T twice.
In the first terminal, type
[source,sh]
----
hppcorbaserver
----

In the second terminal, type
[source,sh]
----
gepetto-gui
----

In the third terminal, type
[source,sh]
----
cd script
python -i rrt.py
----

image::hpp-gui-ur5.png[width="40%",alt="hpp-gui graphical interface"]

You should see the above window displaying a manipulator robot surrounded by obstacles.

In the third terminal, you should see the message "Method solveBiRRT is not implemented yet". Open file +script/motion_planner.py+ in a text editor. The message is produced by method +solveBiRRT+ of class +MotionPlanner+.

Exercise 1
----------

In file +script/motion_planner.py+, remove instruction
[source,python]
----
    print ("Method solveBiRRT is not implemented yet")
----
and implement RRT algorithm between markers
[source,python]
----
      #### RRT begin

      #### RRT end
----

TIP: All classes and functions are implemented by the remote process +hppcorbaserver+ called a +server+.
Instructions in python terminal trigger computation on the server side that stores some objects.
Those objects, mainly +paths+, +roadmap+ can be accessed using the methods described at the end of this page.


Displaying a path
-----------------
While running, your RRT algorithm will produce paths to store in the roadmap
edges. Those paths are stored in a vector and can be displayed by the path
player +pp+. To display the result of your algorithm, type

[source,python]
----
pid = ps.numberPaths () - 1
if pid < 0: raise RuntimeError ("No path in vector")

pp (pid)
----

Hint
----

You can use methods of objects +robot+ and +ps+. To get the list of these
methods with documentation, type in the python terminal

[source,python]
----
    help (robot)
    help (ps)
----

In +class MotionPlanner+, you can access these object by

[source,python]
----
    self.robot
    self.ps
----

Some useful methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[source,python]

#
# Note for all the methods below,
#   - configurations are represented by lists of float,
#   - "index of the path" means index in the vector of paths stored on the server side,
#


# Shoot a random configuration within bounds of robot
#
# return: a configuration
robot.shootRandomConfig ()

# Get nearest node of given input configuration in a connected component of the  current roadmap
#
#  config:               the input configuration
#  connectedComponentId: the index of a connected component in the roadmap,
#                        if is negative, considers the whole roadmap
#                        default value: -1
# return:                nearest configuration,
#                        distance between nearest configuration and input configuration
ps.getNearestConfig (config, connectedComponentId=-1)

# Build direct path between two configurations
#
#  q1, q2:     start and end configurations of the direct path,
#  validation: whether the path should be tested for collision,
#
#  return :    whether the path is valid (True if validation is set to False),
#              index of the path,
#              a string describing why the path is not valid, or empty string
ps.directPath (q1, q2, validation)

# Add a configuration to the current roadmap
#
#  q: configuration
ps.addConfigToRoadmap (q)

# Add an edge to the current roadmap
#
#  q1, q2:    configurations stored in the nodes to be linked by the edge,
#  pathId:    index of the path linking q1 and q2 to be stored in the edge,
#  bothEdges: whether an edge between q2 and q1 should also be added.
ps.addEdgeToRoadmap (q1, q2, pathId, bothEdges)

# Get length of path
#
#  pathId: index of the path
#
#  return: length of the path
ps.pathLength (pathId)

# Get configuration along a path
#
#  pathId:    index of the path
#  parameter: parameter in interval of definition of the path
#
#  return: configuration of path at given parameter
ps.configAtParam (pathId)

# Get the number of connected components of the current roadmap
#
#  return: number of connected components
ps.numberConnectedComponents ()
