Using CORBA
===========

CORBA is a standard middleware that enables different process to exchange
information via services. In our exercises, 3 processes run in parall

. +hppcorbaserver+ or +hpp-manipulation-server+,
. +gepetto-gui+ or +gepetto-viewer-server+, and
. a +python+ terminal.

The two first processes run services that can be triggered remotely by clients
implemented in +python+

Configuring CORBA
-----------------

To connect servers and clients, CORBA needs to run a name server. To know
whether a name server is running, type in a terminal
[source,bash]
----
ps -ef | grep omniNames
----
If you see no process named "omniNames", you need to start one.

[source,bash]
----
omniNames -start 2809 -logdir /tmp
----

WARNING: If you restart +omniNames+ after stopping it, you need either to remove +-start 2809+ from the above command line or to remove log files related to +omniNames+ in +/tmp+.
