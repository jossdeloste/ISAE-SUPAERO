# Project - Dask

The evaluation for this class is a [Dask notebook](https://github.com/SupaeroDataScience/OBD/blob/master/notebooks/EvaluationDaskMLTaxyCabEmpty.ipynb). You should run this notebook on a Daskhub using Kubernetes, like in the [Dask on Kubernetes class](https://supaerodatascience.github.io/OBD/2_5_dask.html) with instructions in [this notebook](https://github.com/SupaeroDataScience/OBD/blob/master/notebooks/Kubernetes_Daskhub.ipynb). You should complete the exercises and answer the questions in the notebook, then turn it in through the [LMS](https://lms.isae.fr/mod/assign/view.php?id=69921). You may work with a partner, in this case make sure to specify in your notebook that you worked together.

The notebook is due on February 18, 2021, by midnight.
