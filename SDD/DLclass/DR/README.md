# Dimensionality Reduction

## Algorithms in Machine Learning, ISAE-SUPAERO

This repository contains course materials for my Machine Learning class on the topic of Dimensionality Reduction:
- <em>dimensionality_reduction_class.pdf</em> : course presentation with teaching content
- <em>dimensionality_reduction_class.ipynb</em> : Python notebook illustrating the course notions
- <em>dimensionality_reduction_class-empty.ipynb</em> : same Python notebook to follow with students during class


### Working with Google Colab

To follow the notebooks with Google Colab, simply go to:
https://github.com/SupaeroDataScience/
- For class follow-up: https://colab.research.google.com/github/SupaeroDataScience/deep-learning/blob/main/DR/dimensionality_reduction_class-empty.ipynb
- For completed notebook: https://colab.research.google.com/github/SupaeroDataScience/deep-learning/blob/main/DR/dimensionality_reduction_class.ipynb

Then click on "Copy to Drive" to be able to execute it and save your copy. The first section of the notebook is there to initialize the environment from Google Colab.
