In this class, we introduce Generative Adversarial Networks, showing an example
of GAN training on MNIST.

[The deep learning book](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) is fully available
online and contains many great examples. Notebook versions of those examples are
available [here](https://github.com/hadrienj/deepLearningBook-Notes). [Chapter
20](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/generative_models.html) covers
generative models and section 20.10.4 specifically covers GANs.
