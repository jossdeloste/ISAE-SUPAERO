    "A digital image is an image composed of picture elements, also known as pixels, each with finite, discrete quantities of numeric representation for its intensity or gray level that is an output from its two-dimensional functions fed as input by its spatial coordinates denoted with x, y on the x-axis and y-axis, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "We represent images as matrixes,\n",
    "\n",
    "Images are made of pixels, and pixels are made of combinations of primary colors (in our case Red, Green and Blue). In this context, images have chanels that are the grayscale image of the same size as a color image, made of just one of these primary colors. For instance, an image from a standard digital camera will have a red, green and blue channel. A grayscale image has just one channel.\n",
