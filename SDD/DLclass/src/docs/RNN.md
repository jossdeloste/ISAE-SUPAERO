[The deep learning book](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) is fully available
online and contains many great examples. Notebook versions of those examples are
available [here](https://github.com/hadrienj/deepLearningBook-Notes). [Chapter
10](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/rnn.html) covers
recurrent neural networks.
