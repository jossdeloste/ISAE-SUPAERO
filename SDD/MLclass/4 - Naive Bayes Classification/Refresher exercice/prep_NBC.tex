\section{Cluedo}

British people write ``rigour'' while US citizens write ``rigor''. A suspect in a hotel wrote this word on a piece of paper, then burnt it and left it behind to be found by the police. Only one letter remains readable; it is a vowel. It is known that 40\% of the hotel's clients are British and 60\% are Americans.\\
\noindent \ding{43} What is the probability the suspect is British?\\
\noindent \ding{43} Suppose now there are more than two english-speaking nationalities staying in this hotel. What part of the previous calculation is unecessary to establish the most probable citizenship of the suspect?

\section{[Optional] Quality check}

In a manufacturing line, 1\% of the production has a defect. A performance test allows to filter out 95\% of faulty products but also excludes 2\% of acceptable ones.\\
\noindent \ding{43} What is the probability of a control error?\\
\noindent \ding{43} What is the probability of a letting a faulty product go through?
